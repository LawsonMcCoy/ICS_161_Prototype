Two primary features

Wall running:
Start wall running by jumping onto the wall with the wall on your side. Jumping on the wall head on or backwards will not result in a wall run.
When wall running their are 4 ways that you can exit a wall run
  1. Jump off the wall using space - this will launch the player up and in the direction they are looking
  2. Begin a grapple
  3. Run off the wall (if the wall comes to an end)
  4. Run into another wall (though if you look in a direction parallel to second wall you will auto start a wall run on the second wall)

Grappling:
Press Q to launch a grapple hook in the direction you are aiming. If it attaches to an object then you will be luanch in the direction it was attached. You are able to release the grapple hook mid launch by pressing E.
